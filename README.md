## 📌 Project Overview

The **GPS Tracker Hardware – STM32F030 + SIM808** is a compact and production-ready embedded hardware design built for real-time location tracking applications.  
This board integrates a **32-bit STM32F030 microcontroller**, **SIM808 GSM+GPS module**, and a **wide-input power supply** on a **4-layer PCB** optimized for signal integrity, RF stability, and robust field performance.

This project demonstrates complete hardware engineering including:
- Full schematic development  
- RF-aware PCB routing  
- Power integrity optimization  
- SIM interface & protection circuitry  
- High-quality 3D modeling  
- Manufacturing-ready outputs (Gerber, Drill, STEP)

This repository provides everything required to **study, modify, manufacture, and extend** the hardware.
